# Spx: Lispy limited to SmartParens

Spx is a minor mode which only takes the idea of "automatic mode switching" from
Lispy and restricts it to simple wrappers around SmartParens commands. Automatic
mode switching means that when the point is at parenthesis/brackets/braces, your
regular keys activate commands instead of self-inserting themselves.
